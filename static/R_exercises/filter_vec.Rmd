Consider the following sequence of 50 integers:

126, 155,  30, 162, 128, 100, 114, 180, 103,  65, 
118,   4, 165, 188,  90,  33,  94,   5, 187, 144, 
121,  23, 152, 153,  75,  45, 139 , 92,  14, 111, 
185, 138,   8, 104,  21, 109,   6, 196,  58, 182,
 64,  62, 161,  88,  29,  41, 181, 175,  66, 149
 
How many of them are greater than 100? What is the sum of those numbers?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
vec <- c(126, 155,  30, 162, 128, 100, 114, 180, 103,  65, 
118,   4, 165, 188,  90,  33,  94,   5, 187, 144, 
121,  23, 152, 153,  75,  45, 139 , 92,  14, 111, 
185, 138,   8, 104,  21, 109,   6, 196,  58, 182,
 64,  62, 161,  88,  29,  41, 181, 175,  66, 149)
vec[vec > 100] %>% length()
vec[vec > 100] %>% sum()
```
