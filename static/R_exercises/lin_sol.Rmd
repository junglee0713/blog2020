library(tidyverse)
```

Make a function `lin_sol()` that solves a given linear equation. For example, to solve
$$5x-3=0,$$
the function takes two coefficients $5$ and $-3$ and `lin_sol(5, -3)` should return the root $0.6$. Make sure that `lin_sol(a, b)` can take care of the case when $a = 0$, where the solution could be either `Infinitely many solutions` or `No solutions`, depending on $b$. Some examples follow:

```{r, echo = F}
lin_sol <- function(a, b) {
  if (a == 0) {
    if (b == 0) {
      print("Infinitely many solutions")
    } else {
      print("No solutions")
    }
  } else {
    y <- -b/a
    re <- paste0("It has a single root ", y)
    print(re)
  }
}
```

```{r}
lin_sol(3, 12)
lin_sol(0, 1)
lin_sol(0, 0)
lin_sol(2, 0)
```
