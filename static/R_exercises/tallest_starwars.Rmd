`starwars` is a dataset from the `dplyr` package that has 87 rows and 13 variables.

- How many `Human` species are there?

- How many values are missing for the variable `height`?

- What is the name of the tallest `Human` character?

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
table(starwars$species, useNA = "ifany")["Human"]
sum(is.na(starwars$height))
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(name, height, species) %>%
  arrange(desc(height))
```
