For a positive integer $n$, define $f(n)$ as follows:
$$f(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{n}{2}, &\text{if }n \text{ is even}, \\
3n+1, &\text{if }n \text{ is odd.}\end{cases}$$
Now form a sequence by repeatedly applying the function, starting with $27$. The first few terms are
$$27, 82, 41, 124, 62, 31, 94, 47, \ldots,$$
How many steps does it take for this sequence to reach $1$? In other words, find the smallest $i$ such that $a_i = 1$, where $a_1 = 27, a_2 = 82, a_3 = 41, \ldots.$
