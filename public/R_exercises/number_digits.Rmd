```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

How many digits does $N=1234567891011121314...9998999910000$ have, where $N$ is formed by concatenating $1,2,3,\ldots,9999,10000$? (_Hint_: you might want to look up the functions `paste()` and `nchar()`)

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
paste(1:10000, collapse = "") %>% nchar()
```
