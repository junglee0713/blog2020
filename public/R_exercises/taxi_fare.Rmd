Write a function that calculates the fare of a taxi ride. Its input is $x$ (distance in km) and the fare is calculated as follows:

- $x$ is rounded up to the nearest integer
- the first kilometer is $5
- every additional kilometer is $2

For example, the fare for a ride of 5.2km is
$$\$5 + 5\times \$2$$
