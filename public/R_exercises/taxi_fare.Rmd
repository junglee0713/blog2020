```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

Write a function that calculates the fare of a taxi ride. Its input is $x$ (distance in km) and the fare is calculated as follows:

- $x$ is rounded up to the nearest integer (you might want to use `ceiling()`)
- the first kilometer is $5
- every additional kilometer is $2

For example, the fare for a ride of 5.2km is
$$\$5 + 5\times \$2 = \$15.$$

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
fare <- function(x) {
  x <- ceiling(x)
  if (x <= 1) {
    f <- 5
  } else {
    f <- 5 + 2*(x-1) 
  }
  return(f)
}
```
