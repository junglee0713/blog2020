`iris` is a dataset that consists of 150 observations of iris flowers. 

- What is the maximum `Sepal.Length`? Which species is it?

- What is the minimum `Petal.Length` of `setosa` species?

- Find the mean `Petal.Width` for each species.

```{r, eval = F, echo = F}
max(iris$Sepal.Length)
iris %>% filter(Species == "setosa") %>%
  pull(Petal.Length) %>%
  min()
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  summarize(mean.PW = mean(Petal.Width))
```
